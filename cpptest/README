Cpptest is the simplest possible program to verify that the environment
is sane. It assumes that Coherence Java is in /opt/coherence and Coherence
C++ is in /opt/coherence-cpp, (on my system these are symlinks) and that 
the JDK package from Debian is used. These are set in environment variables 
in the scripts, e.g. COHERENCE_HOME, JAVA_HOME etc etc. 

To use:

1) In the directory ../server, edit the file start-coh.sh if necessary and run
   it. This will start a Cache server (Coherence itself) and a Proxy server (an
   endpoint for C++ clients to connect to). Wait 10 seconds for it to stabilize.

2) In this directory, edit the Makefile if necessary, make, and run ./cpptest.
   You may also need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/coherence-cpp/lib.

3) If it completes successfully, then Coherence is OK and work may proceed. 

4) If not then, ermm, good luck...
